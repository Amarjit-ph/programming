## Difference of call by value & reference

In call by value the value of actual parameters are copied to functionâ€™s formal parameters and parameters are stored in different memory locations,
So any changes made inside functions are not reflected in actual parameters of the caller.

In Call by Reference: Both the actual and formal parameters refer to the same locations, so any changes made inside the function are actually reflected in actual parameters of the caller.
