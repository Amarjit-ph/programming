# Whatâ€™s the difference between float and double ?

double has 2x more precision then float.

float is a 32 bit IEEE 754 single precision Floating Point Number1 bit for the sign, (8 bits for the exponent, and 23\* for the value), i.e. float has 7 decimal digits of precision.

double is a 64 bit IEEE 754 double precision Floating Point Number (1 bit for the sign, 11 bits for the exponent, and 52\* bits for the value), i.e. double has 15 decimal digits of precision.
