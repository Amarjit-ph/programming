# Introduction

A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Key characteristics:
- Holds memory addresses instead of values
- Requires dereferencing to access the pointed-to value
- Provides indirect access to variables
- Enables dynamic memory management

# Basic Pointer Concepts

### Declaration

Pointers are declared using the asterisk (*) operator:
```cpp
// Basic pointer declaration
int* ptr;      // Pointer to integer
char* cptr;    // Pointer to character
double* dptr;  // Pointer to double

// Declaration with initialization
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x;
```

### Address Operator

The address operator (&) returns the memory address of a variable:
```cpp
int value = 42;
int* ptr = &value;  // ptr now holds the address of value

cout << "Address stored in ptr: " << ptr << endl;
cout << "Value stored at that address: " << *ptr << endl;
```

### Dereferencing

The dereferencing operator (*) accesses the value at a pointer's address:
```cpp
int x = 10;
int* ptr = &x;

cout << *ptr;     // Outputs: 10
*ptr = 20;        // Changes x to 20
cout << x;        // Outputs: 20
```

# Pointer Operations

### Assignment

Pointers can be assigned addresses or other pointers:
```cpp
int first = 10;
int second = 20;
int* ptr1 = &first;
int* ptr2 = &second;

ptr1 = ptr2;  // ptr1 now points to second
```

### Arithmetic

Pointer arithmetic depends on the data type size:
```cpp
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40};
int* ptr = arr;

ptr++;      // Moves to next integer
ptr += 2;   // Moves forward by 2 integers
ptr--;      // Moves back by one integer
```

### Comparison

Pointers can be compared using relational operators:
```cpp
int arr[] = {10, 20, 30};
int* p1 = &arr[0];
int* p2 = &arr[2];

if (p1 < p2) {
    cout << "p1 points to an earlier element than p2";
}
```

# Advanced Pointer Concepts

### Pointers to Pointers

Multiple levels of indirection using double pointers:
```cpp
int value = 10;
int* ptr1 = &value;    // Single pointer
int** ptr2 = &ptr1;    // Pointer to pointer

cout << **ptr2;        // Outputs: 10
```

### Pointer vs Reference

Key differences between pointers and references:
```cpp
// Pointers can be reassigned
int x = 10, y = 20;
int* ptr = &x;
ptr = &y;  // Valid

// References cannot be reassigned
int& ref = x;
ref = y;    // Changes x's value, doesn't make ref refer to y

// Multiple indirection
int** ptrptr = &ptr;  // Valid
int&& refref = ref;   // Invalid - can't reference a reference
```

# Common Pitfalls

### Uninitialized Pointers
```cpp
int* ptr;           // Dangerous! ptr contains garbage address
*ptr = 10;          // Undefined behavior
```

### Dangling Pointers
```cpp
int* ptr = new int(10);
delete ptr;         // ptr is now dangling
*ptr = 20;         // Dangerous! Accessing deleted memory
```

### Memory Leaks
```cpp
void leakMemory() {
    int* ptr = new int(10);
    // Missing delete ptr; - Memory leak!
}
```

# Best Practices

### Always initialize pointers
```cpp
int* ptr = nullptr;  // Good practice
```

### Check for nullptr before dereferencing
```cpp
if (ptr != nullptr) {
    *ptr = 10;
}
```

### Use smart pointers when possible
```cpp
#include <memory>
std::unique_ptr<int> ptr(new int(10));  // Automatic cleanup
```

### Clean up dynamic memory
```cpp
int* ptr = new int(10);
// Use ptr
delete ptr;        // Clean up
ptr = nullptr;     // Avoid dangling pointer
```
