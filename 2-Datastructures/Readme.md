## Introduction

Data structures are specialized formats for organizing, processing, retrieving, and storing data. Understanding data structures is crucial for writing efficient algorithms and developing scalable software solutions.

## Linear Data Structures

### Arrays
- Static Arrays
- Dynamic Arrays (ArrayList)
- Multi-dimensional Arrays
- Time Complexity: O(1) for access, O(n) for insertion/deletion

### Linked Lists
- Singly Linked Lists
- Doubly Linked Lists
- Circular Linked Lists
- Time Complexity: O(1) for insertion/deletion at known position, O(n) for search

### Stack
- LIFO (Last In First Out) principle
- Applications: Expression evaluation, Backtracking
- Time Complexity: O(1) for push/pop

### Queue
- FIFO (First In First Out) principle
- Types:
  - Simple Queue
  - Circular Queue
  - Priority Queue
  - Deque (Double-ended queue)
- Time Complexity: O(1) for enqueue/dequeue

## Non-Linear Data Structures

### Trees
- Binary Trees
- Binary Search Trees (BST)
- AVL Trees
- Red-Black Trees
- B-Trees
- Time Complexity: O(log n) for balanced trees

### Heap
- Min Heap
- Max Heap
- Applications: Priority Queues, Heap Sort
- Time Complexity: O(log n) for insertion/deletion

### Hash Tables
