# QUEUE

A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO). A good example of a queue is any queue of consumers for a resource where the consumer that came first is served first.

Operations on Queue:
Mainly the following four basic operations are performed on queue:

- Enqueue: Adds an item to the queue. If the queue is full, then it is said to be an Overflow condition.
- Dequeue: Removes an item from the queue. The items are popped in the same order in which they are pushed. If the queue is empty, then it is said to be an Underflow condition.
- Front: Get the front item from queue.
- Rear: Get the last item from queue.

Time complexity of all should be O(1)

`Insert at rear & Remove at front`

Example : Printer queue the print request from computers
Implementation : Array & Linked List

Types of Queue :

1. Simple Queue
2. Circular Queue
3. Priority Queue
4. Double Ended Queue

CIRCULAR QUEUE

In Circular Queue, all the nodes are represented as circular. It is similar to the linear Queue except that the last element of the queue is connected to the first element. It is also known as Ring Buffer as all the ends are connected to another end.

PRIORITY QUEUE

A priority queue is another special type of Queue data structure in which each element has some priority associated with it. Based on the priority of the element, the elements are arranged in a priority queue. If the elements occur with the same priority, then they are served according to the FIFO principle

# Implementation

## Queue using array

Circular Array :

1. `Next position = (current Position + 1) % N`
2. `Previous position = (current Position + N - 1 ) % N`

```c++
// CPP program for array
// implementation of queue
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

// A structure to represent a queue
class Queue {
public:
	int front, rear, size;
	unsigned capacity;
	int* array;
};

// function to create a queue
// of given capacity.
// It initializes size of queue as 0
Queue* createQueue(unsigned capacity)
{
	Queue* queue = new Queue();
	queue->capacity = capacity;
	queue->front = queue->size = 0;

	// This is important, see the enqueue
	queue->rear = capacity - 1;
	queue->array = new int[queue->capacity];
	return queue;
}

// Queue is full when size
// becomes equal to the capacity
int isFull(Queue* queue)
{
	return (queue->size == queue->capacity);
}

// Queue is empty when size is 0
int isEmpty(Queue* queue)
{
	return (queue->size == 0);
}

// Function to add an item to the queue.
// It changes rear and size
void enqueue(Queue* queue, int item)
{
	if (isFull(queue))
		return;
	queue->rear = (queue->rear + 1)
				% queue->capacity;
	queue->array[queue->rear] = item;
	queue->size = queue->size + 1;
	cout << item << " enqueued to queue\n";
}

// Function to remove an item from queue.
// It changes front and size
int dequeue(Queue* queue)
{
	if (isEmpty(queue))
		return INT_MIN;
	int item = queue->array[queue->front];
	queue->front = (queue->front + 1)
				% queue->capacity;
	queue->size = queue->size - 1;
	return item;
}

// Function to get front of queue
int front(Queue* queue)
{
	if (isEmpty(queue))
		return INT_MIN;
	return queue->array[queue->front];
}

// Function to get rear of queue
int rear(Queue* queue)
{
	if (isEmpty(queue))
		return INT_MIN;
	return queue->array[queue->rear];
}

// Driver code
int main()
{
	Queue* queue = createQueue(1000);

	enqueue(queue, 10);
	enqueue(queue, 20);
	enqueue(queue, 30);
	enqueue(queue, 40);

	cout << dequeue(queue)
		<< " dequeued from queue\n";

	cout << "Front item is "
		<< front(queue) << endl;
	cout << "Rear item is "
		<< rear(queue) << endl;

	return 0;
}

```

## Queue using Linked List

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

struct QNode {
	int data;
	QNode* next;
	QNode(int d)
	{
		data = d;
		next = NULL;
	}
};

struct Queue {
	QNode *front, *rear;
	Queue()
	{
		front = rear = NULL;
	}

	void enQueue(int x)
	{

		// Create a new LL node
		QNode* temp = new QNode(x);

		// If queue is empty, then
		// new node is front and rear both
		if (rear == NULL) {
			front = rear = temp;
			return;
		}

		// Add the new node at
		// the end of queue and change rear
		rear->next = temp;
		rear = temp;
	}

	// Function to remove
	// a key from given queue q
	void deQueue()
	{
		// If queue is empty, return NULL.
		if (front == NULL)
			return;

		// Store previous front and
		// move front one node ahead
		QNode* temp = front;
		front = front->next;

		// If front becomes NULL, then
		// change rear also as NULL
		if (front == NULL)
			rear = NULL;

		delete (temp);
	}
};

// Driven Program
int main()
{

	Queue q;
	q.enQueue(10);
	q.enQueue(20);
	q.deQueue();
	q.deQueue();
	q.enQueue(30);
	q.enQueue(40);
	q.enQueue(50);
	q.deQueue();
	cout << "Queue Front : " << (q.front)->data << endl;
	cout << "Queue Rear : " << (q.rear)->data;
}

```
