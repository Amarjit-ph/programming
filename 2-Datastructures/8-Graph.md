# Graph

A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

Graphs are used to solve many real-life problems. Graphs are used to represent networks. The networks may include paths in a city or telephone network or circuit network. Graphs are also used in social networks like linkedIn, Facebook.

A graph is a data structure that consists of the following two components:

1. A finite set of vertices also called as nodes.
2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edge

Edges & Graph

1. Directed
2. Undirected

## Representation

The following two are the most commonly used representations of a graph.

1. Adjacency Matrix
2. Adjacency List
